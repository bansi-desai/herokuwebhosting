					<h3>Brief Company History</h3>
					<p>When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives,
						share it. The About Us page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories
						humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. 
						What’s more, good stories are sticky — which means people are more
						likely to connect with them and pass them on.

						Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing 
						how the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families.
						 The company breaks down different pieces of the story into sections 
						 that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture 
						 instead of big chunks of text. Yellow Leaf is clear about 
						 why its brand is different: "Not a Charity," the page reads.
						  And then: "This is the basis for a brighter future, built on a hand up, not a handout."</p>
